::: warning Work in Progress
This section is currently being developed. Moodboards and example images will follow shortly.

The BAUER GROUP image style conveys **professionalism, approachability and technology expertise**. Images support the brand message — they are not filler.

## Style Direction

| Property | How to use | How NOT to use |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Authentic** | Real work environments, real people | Staged stock photos, overly smiling |
| **Professional** | Clean exposure, calm composition | Over-edited, HDR effects, filters |
| **Technological** | Modern workplaces, screens, code | Outdated hardware, clip-art style |
| **Warm** | Natural light, warm tones | Cold, sterile office atmosphere |

## Color Treatment

- **White balance:** Slightly warm (matching the brand orange)
- **Saturation:** Natural, not oversaturated
- **Contrast:** Moderate — no extreme shadows or overexposure
- **Color filters:** No Instagram-style filters

## Image Composition

- **Golden ratio** or rule of thirds for main subjects
- **Whitespace** planned for text overlays
- **Gaze direction** of people into the image, not outward
- **Depth of field** for focus on main subject

## Planned Content

- Moodboard with reference images
- Do/Don't gallery with annotated examples
- Stock photo guidelines (recommended providers, search terms)
- Image editing presets (Lightroom/Capture One)
