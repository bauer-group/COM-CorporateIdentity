# Digital Media

Guidelines for consistent brand representation across digital channels — social media, web and email.

## Overview

| Channel | Formats | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Social Media | Posts, Stories, Banners, Profile Images | In Progress |
| Web | Headers, Banners, Open Graph Images | In Progress |
| Email | Signatures, Newsletter Templates | In Progress |

## Core Principles

- **Consistency** — Uniform appearance across all digital channels
- **Primary color sparingly** — Orange (#FF8500) as accent, not as background
- **Readability** — Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast in digital media as well
- **Responsive** — Templates must work on all screen sizes
